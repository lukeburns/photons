# Spinors are for photons too

## Abstract

Spinors are most frequently used to describe spin-1/2 particles. Here we construct a spinor which describes the electrodynamics and quantum mechanics of a photon in the 3-dimensional geometric algebra. We then introduce a wave equation to which this spinor is a solution. This paper aims to demonstrate that spinors can be used to describe spin-1 particles too and to raise questions regarding the connection between the geometry of spinors and the spin of particles.
